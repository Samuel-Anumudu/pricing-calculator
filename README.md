## Overview

This is my Implementation to the pricing calculator app using Vue.js that allows users to estimate how much Kimoyo's research services cost.

### App Requirements

1. The Study duration determines how much each participant gets for taking part in the study.
2. Selecting Plan 02 (Standard) should auto-populate the Study Structure field with “Online study structure”
3. The additional participants' input field should automatically auto-populate with whatever 20% is of the “Number of participants”
4. Selecting Plan 03 (Premium) should automatically select the following options (but it should not disable the input field as this can still be changed however the user wants):
   - Study moderation needed
   - Discussion guide preparation needed
   - Study session transcripts needed
   - Study report & analysis needed
